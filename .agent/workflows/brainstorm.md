# /brainstorm - VLSI Architecture Exploration

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Explore requirements and architecture before implementation.

---

## Behavior

1. **Ask clarifying questions**
   - What functionality?
   - FPGA or ASIC?
   - Interface requirements?
   - Performance goals?
   - Constraints?

2. **Explore options**
   - Architecture alternatives
   - Trade-offs
   - Risk areas

3. **Document decisions**
   - Summary of requirements
   - Chosen approach
   - Rationale
